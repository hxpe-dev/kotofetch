# kotofetch

kotofetch is a small, configurable CLI tool that displays Japanese quotes in the terminal. It comes with built-in quotes and allows users to customize display options such as padding, width, translation display, and text styles.

## Configuration

### Config File

User configuration lives in:  
```bash
~/.config/kotofetch/config.toml                       # On Linux
~/Library/Application Support/kotofetch/config.toml   # On macOS
%APPDATA%\kotofetch\config.toml                       # On Windows
```

Here you can customize:
- `horizontal_padding` / `vertical_padding` - spacing around quotes
- `width` - max width for text wrapping (`0` for automatic width)
- `show_translation` - translation mode (`"none"`, `"english"`, `"romaji"`)
- `quote_color` - named ANSI colors (`"red"`, `"yellow"`, `"dim"`, etc.) or hex (`"#ffcc00"`)
- `translation_color` - named ANSI colors (`"red"`, `"yellow"`, `"dim"`, etc.) or hex (`"#ffcc00"`)
- `border_color` - named ANSI colors (`"red"`, `"yellow"`, `"dim"`, etc.) or hex (`"#ffcc00"`)
- `font_size` - small, medium, or large (adds spacing between characters)
- `bold` - bold Japanese text (true/false)
- `border` - show a box border (true/false)
- `rounded_border` - show rounded border (need `border` to be enabled) (true/false)
- `source` - show the quote source (true/false)
- `modes` - list of quote files to use (any `.toml` file in `~/.config/kotofetch/quotes/` or built-in)
- `seed` - RNG seed for random quotes (`0` for random seed)
- `centered` - center text (true/false)

Example `config.toml`:
```toml
[display]
horizontal_padding = 3
vertical_padding = 1
width = 50
show_translation = "romaji"
quote_color = "#a3be8c"
translation_color = "dim"
border_color = "#be8ca3"
font_size = "medium"
bold = true
border = true
rounded_border = true
source = true
modes = ["proverb", "anime"]
seed = 0
centered = true
```

### Custom quotes
Built-in quotes are embedded in the binary. To add your own quotes, create:
```bash
~/.config/kotofetch/quotes/                       # On Linux
~/Library/Application Support/kotofetch/quotes/   # On macOS
%APPDATA%\kotofetch\quotes\                       # On Windows
```
- Place any `.toml` file there.
- The filenames can be arbitrary, the program automatically reads all `.toml` files in this folder.
- Each `.toml` must follow this structure:

```toml
[[quote]]
japanese = "逃げちゃダメだ"
translation = "You mustn't run away."
romaji = "Nigeccha dame da"
source = "Neon Genesis Evangelion"

[[quote]]
japanese = "人は心で生きるんだ"
translation = "People live by their hearts."
romaji = "Hito wa kokoro de ikiru nda"
source = "Your Name"
```
- These custom quotes automatically merge with the built-in ones.

You can see the built-in quotes in the [quotes folder](quotes/).

## Usage
```bash
kotofetch                               # display a quote following the config
kotofetch --horizontal-padding 3        # override specific config parameter temporarily
kotofetch --modes anime,mycustomquotes  # display quotes from specific files
```
